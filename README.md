# Crop Prediction Using Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning-based solution for crop prediction. By analyzing environmental factors such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, ph, rainfall, temperature, and humidity, this model predicts the most suitable crop for a given condition. This project is ideal for researchers, students, and developers interested in applying machine learning to agriculture.

## Features
- Predicts the best crop based on environmental factors.
- Utilizes Python with popular libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.
- Simple and easy-to-understand implementation.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating the machine learning models.
- **Pandas** and **NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or later
- pip (Python package installer)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khanasifhere/crop_pred_ml.git
   cd crop_pred_ml
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. Run the main script to start crop prediction:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to input environmental factors and receive crop recommendations.

## Project Structure
